## MID ASSESSMENT (Inheritance):
#### Suppose that we are required to model students and teachers in our application. 

#### We can define a superclass called Person to store common properties such as name and address, and subclasses Student and Teacher for their specific properties. 

- For students, we need to maintain the courses taken and their respective grades; add a course with grade, print all courses taken and the average grade. 
- Assume that a student takes no more than 30 courses for the entire program. 
- For teachers, we need to maintain the courses taught currently, and able to add or remove a course taught. 
- Assume that a teacher teaches not more than 5 courses concurrently.

- Create a Program to demonstrate above scenario.
